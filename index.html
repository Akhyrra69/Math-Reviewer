    <h3>1. Differentiate Prime from Composite Numbers</h3>
    <p>
        A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
        Example: 5 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 5.
        A composite number is a number greater than 1 that has more than two divisors.
        Example: 6 is composite because its divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

    <div id="learn-more-prime-composite" class="learn-more-content">
        <h4>Prime vs. Composite Numbers:</h4>
        <p>To understand the difference between prime and composite numbers, let's explore the characteristics and examples in greater detail:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc.</li>
            <li>Composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How to Identify Prime Numbers:</h5>
        <p>Prime numbers can only be divided evenly by 1 and themselves. To check if a number is prime:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by checking divisibility by small primes (2, 3, 5, 7, etc.).</li>
            <li>If none divide evenly, then the number is prime.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, to check if 19 is prime:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>19 ÷ 2 (not divisible)</li>
            <li>19 ÷ 3 (not divisible)</li>
            <li>19 ÷ 5 (not divisible)</li>

        <h5>Steps to Find Factors:</h5>
        <ol>

    <p>
        Decimal numbers can be visualized in various ways, such as using grids, blocks, number lines, or even money. These models help students see how decimal values are parts of a whole.
        Example: 0.5 can be visualized as half of a number line or as 50 cents in money.

    <p>
        To convert a decimal to a fraction, write the decimal as a fraction with the denominator as a power of 10. For example, 0.75 can be written as 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4.
        To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, 3/4 = 0.75.

        To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and the denominators. For example: 2/3 × 4/5 = (2 × 4)/(3 × 5) = 8/15.
        To divide fractions, multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor. For example: 3/4 ÷ 2/3 = 3/4 × 3/2 = 9/8.

        Word problems involving fractions require understanding how to apply multiplication or division to real-world situations. For example, if you have 3/4 of a chocolate bar and you want to divide it equally among 3 people, you divide 3/4 by 3.
        Example: 3/4 ÷ 3 = 1/4 per person.

        To add or subtract decimals, align the decimal points and proceed as with whole numbers. For multiplication, multiply as if the decimals are whole numbers, then count the total number of decimal places in both numbers combined. For division, divide as with whole numbers, then adjust the decimal point.

        To compare decimals, align the decimal points and compare digits from left to right. To order decimals, arrange them from least to greatest or greatest to least.
